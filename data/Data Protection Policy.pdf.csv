Where DMI wants to process Personal Data that was collected from the Data Subject for purposes other than the purpose it was originally intended for, DMI must seek the consent of its Data Subjects in clear and concise writing. Any such request must include the original purpose for which information was collected, and also the new, or additional, purposes. The request must also include the reason for the change in purposes. Special Categories Personal Data Processing DMI will not process Special Categories of Personal Data unless: 1. The Data Subject has explicitly provided consent. 2. It is necessary to do so for a legitimate purpose.
"Carry out the Data Controller’s obligations or exercise the Data Subject’s specific rights in the field of employment, social security, and social protection law. Page 5 of 12 V1.0DMI_GE_POL_004 ● Necessary processing for contract performance or contract entry. ● Necessary processing for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Controller is subject. ● It is necessary for the establishment, exercise, or defence of legal claims or whenever courts are acting in their judicial capacity. a.

Storage limitation and retention period of personal data must be consistent. All personal data must be adequately protected based on.
The existing statutory regulations and applicable industry principles.

DMI will anonymize and/or pseudonymize Personal Data rather than erase if: o
The law prohibits erasure. Erasure would impair the legitimate interests of the Data Subject. Erasure is not possible without disproportionate effort due to the specific type of storage. Where the Data Subject has disputed the accuracy of the Personal Data, DMI disagrees with that assertion and resolution has not been reached. DMI must retain Personal Data for no longer than is necessary and in accordance with the Records Retention and Destruction Policy.

Page 7 of 12 V1.0DMI_GE_POL_004 o When the processing of Personal Data is involved."
Of personal data may result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of a data subject, DMI is required to conduct a data protection impact assessment (DPIA) and then consult with the privacy officer. ● The privacy officer will be required to consult with the data protection commissioner (DPC) in certain instances (prior to processing personal data where a DPIA assessment indicates that the processing would result in a high risk to a data subject and/or where measures cannot be taken by DMI to fully mitigate the risk.). ● When relevant, and where it does not have a direct impact on the processing of personal data, the privacy officer will be required to consult with the data protection commissioner (DPC).
"Negative impact on the Data Subject, Privacy settings for any of DMI technology and platforms that interact with, or process Personal Data about Data Subjects will be set to the most private by default. j. Third Party Transfer Requirements DMI will transfer Personal Data to a Third Party outside of the EEA where any of the following apply: ● The Data Subject has given explicit Consent to the proposed transfer. ● The transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract between the Data Subject and DMI, or the implementation of pre-contractual measures taken in response to a request by."

In cases where there is a requirement to transfer Personal Data to a Third Party, the Data Subject should be notified prior to providing information to DMI by way of a Privacy Notice. k. Third Parties Relationships Policy Where DMI makes use of a Third-Party supplier to process Personal Data on its behalf, DMI must ensure that the processor has adequate measures to protect Personal Data."

Departments must notify the Privacy Officer immediately when in receipt of a Data Subject access request and must provide the Privacy Officer with all necessary support to allow a response in accordance with regulatory timelines. m. Record of Processing Activities (ROPA) ● DMI must implement and maintain a written record of processing activity under its responsibility. Two separate records of processing activities should be developed, one for where DMI operates as a Data Controller, and the other for where DMI operates as a Data Processor. ● Maintaining records of processing activities enables DMI to demonstrate compliance with Data Protection laws.
"DMI must keep records of their processing activities, which at a minimum should include the following information: the collection, storage, use, transfer, protection, deletion of Personal Data, the purposes for which the data is being processed, data categories processed, and details of the technical and organizational measures taken to protect the data. DMI will ensure that the ROPA’s are regularly reviewed and updated. n. Personal Data Breach Management Information security and privacy incidents and events must be reported immediately through the appropriate channels. All Employees have an obligation to report actual or potential Data Protection compliance failures."
This allows DMI to investigate the failure and take remedial steps if necessary. Maintain a register of compliance failures. Notify the applicable Supervisory Authority (SA) of any compliance failures that are material either in their own right or as part of a pattern of failures. When DMI learns of a suspected or actual Data breach, an internal investigation must be performed, and the appropriate remedial measures must be taken in a timely manner. DMI Privacy Officer must notify the Supervisory Authorities of breaches related to Personal Data unless the breach is unlikely to result in.

This notification must be done without undue delay. o.

As part of the induction process, further data protection training will be provided at least every year or whenever there is a substantial change in the law or to the policy and procedure. DMI must ensure that employees undergo the relevant privacy and information security training on an annual basis. DMI will maintain employee GDPR training completion records. 6.
