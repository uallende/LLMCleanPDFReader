It is the responsibility of all persons to: ● Identify situations where lone working forms part of normal working arrangements. ● Identify working situations that require workers to work alone and request that a risk assessment is carried out. ● Put in place the controls necessary to reduce the risk to an acceptable level. ● Put in place the necessary arrangements for communication in the event of an emergency. ● If it is determined that the lone working activity cannot be carried out safely, it must not be undertaken, and alternative arrangements must be made. ● Necessary arrangements must be made to ensure that personnel at the office or a designated contact person is made aware of situations where lone working is taking place. 4.22 Pregnant Employees DMI shall adhere to the provisions of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (General Application) Regulations 2007: Protection of Pregnant, Post Natal and Breastfeeding Employees. Pregnant Employee Assessments are carried out as required. 20 These Regulations apply to employees who are pregnant, a post-natal employee (gave birth not more than 14 weeks preceding a material date) or are breast-feeding (within the first 26 weeks after birth). On receiving notification that an employee is pregnant, DMI must assess the specific risks to that employee and take action to ensure that she is not exposed to anything in the workplace that will damage either her safety or health or that of her developing child. If the risk assessment identifies possible exposure to these specified risks, DMI must ensure that these employees do not carry out duties which would result in such exposure. If it is not practicable to ensure the safety or health of the employee or unborn child through protective or preventative measures, then DMI must adjust temporarily the working conditions or the working hours (or both) of the employee concerned. If this does not remove the risk, then provide suitable alternative work. If that is not possible, DMI should assist the employee in receiving health and safety leave under the Maternity Protection Act. Persons requiring more information as to their entitlements under this legislation should contact their Manager. 4.23 Manual Handling".
At DMI, manual handling will, where possible, be avoided. All manual handling operations that cannot be avoided shall be identified and listed, and this listing shall be subject to review. All such manual handling which has the foreseeable potential for causing an accident and/or injury shall be reviewed in order to: ● see if it is necessary to carry out such work. ● establish what environmental improvements might be implemented. ● establish what reduction of load and/or mechanical aids may be provided to reduce the risk of accident. All such manual handling shall be carried out only by workers provided with appropriate training in lifting and handling techniques by qualified trainers. Records of such training will be maintained. All relevant employees are reminded of their obligation to participate in training provided by DMI to ensure that they understand how to conduct manual handling operations safely, and to work to the guidelines provided in training and subsequently by their manager. 4.24 Ergonomics The guidelines below give suggested methods to ensure an ergonomically suitable workstation. Any discomfort or injury resulting from your workstation set up should be reported to the Facilities Co-Ordinator. 4.25 Allergens Allergens can present a health concern for some individuals in the workplace if a person is exposed to a particular substance. This can trigger different symptoms. Allergens/triggers can be found anywhere in the environment. 21 DMI aims to prevent exposure to trigger

Your Keyboard and Mouse ● Elbows should be slightly above the height of the keyboard. ● Ensure your mouse and keyboard are positioned close to each other, at the same level with easy reach. ● Position your keyboard and mouse such that your upper arm can stay in a relaxed position, elbows at 110-135° and arms close to your side. ● Do not deviate/bend your wrist when using your mouse; your wrist should remain in a straight alignment to your forearm. Your Monitor ● Your monitor should be positioned at approximately an arm's length (20-40") from you when sitting at your desk and should be placed directly in front of your keyboard. ● Eye level should be one to three inches from the top of your screen. ● Ensure your monitor is free from reflections and glare and that your brightness and contrast features are working. 24 ● Take frequent breaks from your monitor, practice the 30/30 rule: every 30 minutes take a 30-second break and focus on an object in the distance (30m). 25 5.0 Hazard Identification and Control Measures Where hazards cannot be removed, it is necessary to secure the safety of employees and others by putting in place hazard control measures to reduce the risk inherent in each identified hazard to an acceptable level. This shall take account of standards laid down by EU directives, National Acts, Regulations, Codes of Practice, Guidelines, British and Irish Standards and custom and practice within the industry. Where it is reasonably practicable, the company commits itself to dealing with identified hazards by using the following Hierarchy of Risk Controls (Figure 1) and the General Principle of Prevention detailed in the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 (Figure 2) in conjunction with the Manager responsible for the area concerned. 5.1 Hierarchy of Controls The hierarchy of control is a step-by-step approach to eliminating or reducing workplace hazards. It ranks controls from the most effective level of protection to the least effective level of protection. When choosing a control method, start from the top of the inverted pyramid. Assess the feasibility of the first layer of controls (elimination) before moving on to the second layer (substitution). Continue this process until you reach the bottom of the pyramid and have identified as many controls as needed to adequately protect the worker from the hazard. The hierarchy of control is illustrated in Figure 1. Figure 1 Hierarchy of Controls 26 5.2 General Principles of Prevention A control measure is simply the step taken to remove a hazard (eliminate) or at least reduce it to an acceptable level (minimise). The adopted control measures are the most significant part of the risk assessment, as they set out the steps that must be followed to protect people. Some control measures may already be in place. Additional measures may be needed to reduce the risk further. When deciding on controls, the company should consider the general principles of prevention. These are a hierarchy of control that set out how to manage hazards. The focus should be to remove the hazard, so that people are protected. If this is not possible, then work through the principles until the task is as safe as reasonably practicable. Reliance on personal protective equipment (PPE) should be one of the last steps in the process (not the first). The General Principles of Prevention are summarised as follows: ● Avoid the risk - If possible, get rid of the hazard then people are not exposed to other risks. The company should apply this principle first ● Evaluate unavoidable risks - Requires you to undertake risk assessments. If the hazard cannot be removed it must be assessed. ● Combat the risk at its source - Try to deal with the hazard at its root. If there is a noisy machine in the workplace, giving employees hearing protection is not dealing with the root of the problem. If the machine is enclosed so that it is not noisy or if the machine is replaced with a quieter one, this is combating the risk at its source. ● Adapt the work to the individual - This is the principle of arranging the workplace and tasks to take into account the employees and reduce the effect of work on health. ● Adapt the workplace in line with technical progress - Safersystems of work are always being developed. The company should keep up to date with new systems, so that it can put them into use in the workplace
