R.Soc. Open Sci. 2:150266. Vast numbers of scientific articles are published each year, some of which attract considerable attention, and some of which go almost unnoticed. Here, we investigate whether any of this variance can be explained by a simple metric of one aspect of the paper’s presentation: the length of its title. Our analysis provides evidence that journals which publish papers with shorter titles receive more citations per paper. These results are consistent with the intriguing hypothesis that papers with shorter titles may be easier to understand, and hence attract more citations. Subject Category: Research 1. Introduction Subject Areas: Written communication is now being recorded online on a complexity/computational physics/statistical massive scale [1–5]. Colossal amounts of data on collective physics information gathering and distribution via online.

Science and scientific endeavors also generate extensive written communication, in the form of papers. We define a paper to be more successful than others if it has received a greater number of citations. The online database Scopus contains citation records of authors for correspondence: papers, offering remarkable insights into academic conversation. Adrian Letchford Recently, advances have been made in quantifying scientific email output based on publication statistics [24–28]. A number of studies have provided evidence that the long-term success of scientists depends on their early publications [29,30]. Further analyses have indicated that a paper's success can be partially predicted by its early success as well as the reputation of the authors [31–33]. In addition, papers in particular academic domains gain more citations than others [35]. Here, we consider whether we can find any evidence that the style in which a paper is written may influence its success.
"Relate to its success. Electronicsupplementarymaterialisavailable. Specifically, we consider the length of the article title chosen by the author and investigate whether the length bears any relation to the number of citations. Previous studies have explored different characteristics of scientific paper titles [36–41]. A subset of these studies have focused on identifying two stylistic attributes of academic writing and the use of a colon or question in a paper’s title [36–39]. Those which have investigated the relationship between the length of an article’s title and the number of citations it receives have been limited to relatively small samples, up to a maximum of 2200 papers [40,41]. These analyses have reported conflicting results, with one study suggesting that papers with longer titles might receive more citations [41] and another finding no evidence of a relationship [40]. Here, we exploit data on a much larger sample of 140,000 papers in order to investigate whether a paper’s title length bears any relation to the number of citations it receives. 2. Results We analyzed data provided by Scopus, one of the leading bibliometric platforms. As a Scopus user, we can search R.Soc.opensci.2:150266 and export data on journal articles in batches of 20,000 records, including data on how often each article has been cited since publication. We downloaded data on the 20,000 most cited papers in each year between 2007 and 2013. We determined the number of characters in each paper’s title, including spaces and punctuation. Using the year 2010 as an example, we ranked the papers’ titles by the number of characters."
Title length and citations (Figure 1a). Upon visual inspection, there appears to be a high concentration of papers with short titles and many citations, as well as a high concentration of papers with long titles and few citations. We find that for the top 20,000 most highly cited papers published in 2010, papers with shorter titles receive more citations (Kendall’s τ = −0.07, N = 15,395, p < 0.001). We apply the same analysis to each year in our sample and find that papers from all years exhibit this relationship between title length and citations (Figure 1b; all τs < −0.042, all ps < 0.001, α = 0.05, Kendall’s τ correlation with falsediscovery rate (FDR) correction). Some journals may attract a greater number of citations for their papers due to their reputation. To remove any potential influence of the journal in which a paper is published on the relationship between citations received and paper title length, we rank all papers in terms of the number of citations received and transform these ranks into percentiles. We calculate percentiles in terms of the length of papers’ titles in the same fashion. In the transformed dataset, for papers published in 2010, we find that papers with shorter titles receive more citations (Figure 1c; τ = −0.020, N = 15,395, p < 0.001, Kendall’s τ correlation). Again, we run parallel analyses for the 20,000 most cited papers in each year between 2007 and 2013. For years 2007–20
"their journal. Again, using 2010 as an example, we calculated the median number of citations and median title length for each journal. We found that journals which published papers with shorter titles also tend to receive more citations per paper (figure 2a; Kendall’s τ = -0.19, N = 361, p < 0.001). Parallel analyses for papers published in each year between 2007 and 2013 show that this relationship holds for papers published in all 7 years in our sample (figure 2b; 2012: τ = -0.1, N = 320, p < 0.05; 2013: τ = -0.11, N = 352, p < 0.01; all other years: all τs ≤ -0.14, all ps < 0.001, α = 0.05; Kendall’s τ correlation with FDR correction). Finally, we carried out a complementary aggregated analysis across all years of data in our sample. We ranked all papers published in a given year by citations received and by title length, and transformed these ranks into percentiles for that year. Again, we found that journals which publish papers with shorter titles also tend to receive more citations per paper (figure 3; τ = -0.19, N = 625, p < 0.001, Kendall’s τ correlation). Our primary analysis is based on rank-based statistics. To complement our analysis, we fit a mixed-effects model to the log of the number of citations a paper receives as a function of its title length, controlling for the journal in which
"c is the number of citations received by paper p published in journal j. The distribution of j,p citations received by a paper is highly positively skewed. For this reason, we log the citation counts, so that the distribution of the residuals of our model, (cid:4), is closer to a Gaussian distribution. The grand intercept is I, whereas I is an intercept for each journal. There is a fixed slope L for the number of j characters in the title of paper ppublished in journal j.

The values of the slope L are given for all years in Table 1. 3. Discussion In this study, we investigate whether the length of a scientific paper's title is related to the number of citations it receives. We analyzed the 20,000 most highly cited papers for the years 2007–2013, representing a sample size between 1.12% and 1.53% of all papers published in each of these years. Previous studies analyzing much smaller sets of papers have reported conflicting evidence, suggesting either that the relationship is positive (60%) or negative (40%). Figure 3. Journals that publish papers with shorter titles receive more citations per paper. For each year in our dataset, we ranked all of the papers in terms of the number of citations received and in terms of the length of their titles, and transformed the ranks into percentiles for a given year. For each journal, we then calculated the average quantile of the citations and of the title lengths, across papers and across years. Here, each blue circle represents a journal, and the size of each circle represents the number of papers in our sample for that journal. Again, we find that journals that publish papers with shorter titles also tend to receive more citations per paper (Kendall's τ = −0.19, N = 625, p < 0.001). The length of a paper's title bears no relation to
Original text: "in others. When citation counts are adjusted for the journal in which the paper is published, we find that the strength of the evidence for the relationship between title length and citations received is reduced. Our results show that journals which publish papers with shorter titles tend to receive more citations per paper. We propose three possible explanations for these results. One potential explanation is that high-impact journals might restrict the length of their papers’ titles. Similarly, incremental research might be published under longer titles in less prestigious journals. A third possible explanation is that shorter titles may be easier to understand, enabling wider readership and increasing the influence of a paper. Our findings provide evidence that elements of the style in which a paper is written may relate to the number of times it is cited. Future analysis will investigate whether further stylistic attributes of the language used in a paper can be related to the number of citations it receives. 4. Methods We retrieve bibliometric data from Scopus (http://www.scopus.com) between 21 October 2014 and 14 November 2014. To obtain data on the 20000 most cited papers published in each of the 7 years from 2007 to 2013, we search for any paper that is marked by Scopus as an ‘article’ with the following search query: DOCTYPE(ar) AND PUBYEAR = {year}, where {year} is replaced by each of the years 2007–2013. In total, we retrieve 140000 records. In 2007, 6 Scopus reports 1302973 published papers which increase to 1788065 papers in 2013. The top 200
